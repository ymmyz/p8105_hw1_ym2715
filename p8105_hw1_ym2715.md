Solutions to Problem 1 & 2
================

I'm an R Markdown document!

Problem 1
=========

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from a *normal distribution*:

``` r
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

    ## [1] 100

Problem 2
=========

I can take the mean of the sample, too! The mean is 0.0288683.
