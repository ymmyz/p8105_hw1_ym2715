# Problem 1

```{Data Frame Setup}
unif_sample = runif(10, min = 0, max = 5)

logi_sample = unif_sample > 2

chara_sample = character(10)

factor_data = c(1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3)
factor_sample = factor(factor_data)

frame_sample = data.frame(a = unif_sample, b = logi_sample, c = chara_sample, d = factor_sample)
frame_sample
```
 This is my data frame `frame_sample`


# Problem 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
